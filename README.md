# LexicalAnalysis
Implement the lexical analysis task for a limited version (i.e., the depth of the nested loops) of a programming language. 
Given a segment of the source code, my C++ code should analyze the code and extract all tokens, which include: Keywords, 
Identifiers, Constants, Operators, Delimiters. My C++ code should input a text Ô¨Åle from user, 
which contains the expression he/she wants the compilers to analyze.
Then, my code should parse the input, detect the tokens, classify them, and print out the results.
